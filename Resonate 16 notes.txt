Is the projector / screen as important as the camera in how we experience photographs? 

Karl Gerstner - designing programmes. What can happen to the evolution of visual arts based on scientific developments.

Kristian Knoblock - strings on speakers with projector  - as sound amplified, projected light is split into RGB. 

Building something that will be destroyed as its purpose. The ultimate disposable camera?

Look in to modern scientific telescopes and composite images using different wavelengths.

Interesting looking openFramworks project - could be good to learn from.

Looking for "performable musical instruments"

"Live" photography, vs the slow waiting for development of film. Does this make the camera more of an "instrument"? Polaroids as performative cameras? Maybe it's the process of seeing the photo in the context of the capture that is the performance? Seeing the result in real time/place.

"Calculating sound as soon as it's needed" or happens. Massive processing power changes things. See also live computational photography. Watching a Face Swap app is performative photography. http://peteashton.tumblr.com/post/142687918327/prostheticknowledge-vape-face-video-upload-from

Instruments of measure, instruments of wonder. Hankins and Silverman (Instruments and the Imagination)
Music instruments as scientific measuring instruments. Cameras as scientific instruments. "Devices used to provoke wonder."

Instruments vs Tools

Tool: Utilitarian, Task Specific, Efficient, Optimized. 
Instrument: Not goal specific, changes context, idiosyncratic, idiomatic.

Instrument as Extended System. Electric guitar needs a system to make it work (effects peddles, amplifier, etc make up the "instrument") . What is the extended system of a camera? Instagram? cf Flusser. Playing an instrument as part of an i/o system. 

Lucier - Music for solo performer - hooked up brainwaves to transducers. 1965

Sensorband - biofeedback peformance.

Sensors. 
- Sense
- Interpret
- Produce Response
 
Wekinator. 
Interpret is difficult and annoying. Solution - to use normal movement and sound to build new instruments.

**Memo**

Semi autonomous things we interact with. 

We control / create our tools and then our tools control etc us. 

**K&C**

Project onto a mesh of strings. Loom? 

Physically hacking projectors to increase brightness. 

"Humble but beautiful object"

Standing waves - precision controlled waves in tanks with light shines through them. 

Surfaced are really important to mediate realities.
