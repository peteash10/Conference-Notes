Head-mounted camera synced with brain scan. Use neural sparks and data to manipulate video. Neural equiv of the depth-cam. 

Using slow-mo and immediate repeat to emphasise important things being recorded in memory. Perception of time is subjective. 

Cleary Connoly's helmets. Technically uninteresting (periscopes) but very good public interactive devices. Range of subtly different perceptions which re-enforce the same basic ideas - that the eyes work together but one is stronger. Gateway to the science of perception and image analysis through a very simple idea. Need similar perception altering devices for Camera Obscura stuff. 

Real time rolling shutter.
