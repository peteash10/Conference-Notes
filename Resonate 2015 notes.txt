**Lichens**

Dialogue / feedback loop between human energy / electricity and machine electricity. All based on Voltage. 

Most interesting instrument is the human voice. 

To say "This Is The Only Way" is ridiculous. [Only way within a context, surely? Is this still a problem? Seems a bit mid-20thC]

Improvisation is to do with consciously listening to others and you surroundings.

**Noto-index** exhib is a big fancy screen and a kinect-type sensor but when we saw it it wasn't working. Still, there was the desire to wave in front of the sensor to see what the effect might be, and when the random fluxuations of the screen matched the movements of the people we assumed we had caused them. This sort of associative sympathic relationship is fascinating and needs further study in relation to "interactive" artworks. Is it enough to have a random abstract animation and an unplugged kinect sensor? Placebo-interactive art. 

Behind the noto-index piece is what I think is the better artwork - a simple slab of black with every Unicode character printed on it in white in a rigid grid. The English / Western characters take up the first few inches and then the enormity of human graphical communication spreads into the distance. It's shown here as a backdrop, under a glass floor, but it really needs to be mounted in a way that encourages exploration. I've seen "all of unicode" in books, animations and websites but rendered at this scale is perfect. Something to consider copying.

8bit Reggae book

Algorithms. The role played by procedures in cultural production. 

Using digital / algorithmic production systems to demonstrate how they work. PoD tshirts, etc. Maybe I should do an Amazon tshirt bot? 

Syncing up photos based on metadata, not just location but time of day, etc. See my IMG 2448 thing. 

Generative Detective - Greg Borenstein. Works because human cognition fills in gaps between random content. 

A Ship Adrift - Bridle. Tracks weather and imagines how a boat would have moved. Then maps that fictional journey. Something similar with Fitbit type personal data? Pugh's invigilator? 

Matt Richardson - Descriptive Camera using Mechanical Turk. 

Fatima Al-Qadiri comic book showing how the logic of tech changes how we write and communicate, and therefore how we think.

Book: Waves and Forms by Zimmermann, Basile

Uses Creolization of food to explain recent developments in media hybridisation. 


**Idea**

Exploring the interstitial moments of repose during conversation / talk. Simple idea - edit out all the speech from a talk video. Been done with GW Bush breathing? Long exposures show this - the person at repose is still. The action is blurred. 

# Friday

**Nicholas Nova**

Design Fictions

Curious Rituals. New postures, gestures and movements connected to tech. 

Mundane design fiction. TBD catalogue. Speculative design in SkyMall and pound shops. 

Self driving car manual - taking existing language and design which deals with user needs and concerns (child-proofing, etc) and applying to emerging tech to understand the issues that might surround it. 

Interested in the symptoms of the thing, not the thing itself. 

**Bare Conductive - Matt Johnson**

Interactivity Everywhere.

Capacitive Sensing using the board and the paint. Proximity sensing. Very interesting. 	

**Paulien Dresscher - Cinekid**

Room Racers - race track made of objects laid under projections. 

Projection mapping within a cuboid paper dome to create illusion of many screen in mid air. 

Brainwave powered ears make physical invisible processes in the brain. Similar to that amplified colours in video. 

Slowing down, and lowering in pitch, bird songs so people can copy them, then speeding up the audio / video so people are singing birdsong. Look at how controlling speed can allow people to communicate on different levels with different creatures? 

Water Light Graffiti - water-reactive screen of LEDs. 

Golan & Kyle hand morphing box. Cognitive feedback from seeing your hand change. Something about fucking with perception. Phantom limbs? 

A lot of this stuff is about feedback mechanisms. Do this, then something happens. which I guess is what Interactive Art means...

**Idea**

Conductive paint used to paint controls onto the camera obscura. Clunk switch to turn back to "manual" controls. Possibility of another layer of more interactive, but fragile, controls to do other things like take photos?

@obviousjim

Flusser: Constrained by limitations of camera apparatus. No new information is created. Experimental photographer is one who is conscious of the camera and works to subvert it. Then free to create images outside of the existing program.

Bruce Sterling's camera of the future. Absorbs all the photons in the room, then calculates a picture from that information.

The weight of a photograph has a physical connection with reality. Kinect images were divorced from reality. 

How can an artist who works with code create a self portrait? 

Other works:
- Postcards from Google Earth - Clement Valla. Reveals structure through failing in interesting ways
- Sophie Kahn - Triple Portrait of E. Portrait moves during scanning process which is then 3d printed. Industrial	 engineering scanner. 
- Memex | Duologue Music Video. MLF&A Studio. Photogrametry. 
- Heather Dewey-Hagborg - Stranger Visions. Using DNA from found hair to recreate a visual idea of that person. 

Many photos often make one "image". Maybe the photograph as a unit is becoming irrelevant. Now in aggregate.  

Look for people who don't think they are "photographers" but whose practice is effectively photography. 

Exquisite City workshop. "Elaborate cadaver"

Programme to 3d scan objects: Photoscan.

3D scans used to built city in Unity. 

Must investigate Unity. 

Future camera maybe allows us to take photos of things that don't exist.

Photon Shower

Crafting Narratives

Reverse archeology - designing the cues and clues for alien cultures. 

Design Fiction, basically. 

What we experience is a brain-made reality. 

Theatricality in design - audience emphasising with the "users"

Why does perception of time change? Could be processing of new information. 

**Lauren McCarthy**

Goffman's Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life

Explicit feedback isn't wanted in meatspace context.

Developing rituals around inanimate, useless objects. 

Ask her for a list of these projects. Very interesting.

**Irini Papadimitriou**

Digital Programmes Manager at the V&A

Karen should talk to her.

**Berg guy**

Martin Arnold - Cinemnesia

Photometry - use Leon's stuff. 

**Resonate action points**
	•	Email James George @obviousjim with my work. 
	•	XCW - leave photos of opposite areas along the route. Maybe in those Xmas balls? 
	•	Mix up all XCW photos to see how that feels. 
	•	Camera Obscura mirror controls using Bare Conductive paint within the frame. 
	•	Revisit IMG 2442 and Amazon tshirts, re "Using digital / algorithmic production systems to demonstrate how they work."
	•	Placebo-interactive art. Make some. Maybe for Fierce? 
	•	Bring a group of "young artists" to Resonate next year. Maybe work with Amy Martin / BOM / BIAD for funding? Or Sampad? 
	•	Investigate Unity for 3D environments and try out the Exquisite City idea.
