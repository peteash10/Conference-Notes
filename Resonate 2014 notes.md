Experimental practice. 

Control is an illusion to be be worked towards but complexity fucks it. 

Latency in animalistic forms. 

Digital and analogue feedback. Develop interactions between things. 

AI worked really well in a finite world. 

Construct a lens which opens up a new conversation. (Powers of Ten)

Contribute themselves within a larger context. (Instagram feeds?) 

Technology is part of a longer conversation.

Digital should be replaced with "algorithmisation" of the world to understand what is going on around us in the physical world via machines. 

Computers are the physicalisation of logic. They need space. 

Inverted programming - just fucking around with code etc. hacking 

Eniarof 
Atelier Hyperm√©dia
The book of Eniarof

Unterplay - utterly minimal games. 
Oko. App Store. 
The temporality of Solitaire. Being in the moment. 

Calling something "culture" does not necessarily mean it is "art". 

Cyclical nature of algorithmic art. Easy to replicate. WTC space invaders.

KLAUS OBERMAIER, - dance and motion capture. 

DAITO MANABE - electro face manipulation stimulation 

KYLE MCDONALD - video flow

All interesting. Lots of connections with computational photography.

LAB 212

StOP-it - post it note tenori-on

People on pop - people echo frames from dance which are photographed and animated when accurate enough. 

Starfield - kinetic + swing + projected stars. 

Playtime.lab212.org

Bruits du fonds - led moves up and down according to measured depth of lake. Long exposure photo taken of light. References wifi mapping led stick. Quad copter boat. Revealing the invisible. 

Appel d'air. Big fan triggered by kid blowing on small flower windmill. 

Roomba connected to projection map which "erases" floor to reveal live video view of floor below, tromp d'olie style.

Physical value of sound. 
(Sam and David would be interested in this)

The sound of the earth. A spherical record mounted as a globe. Playback only for land masses where Suzuki made field recordings. 

Musical kettle - whistle powered by arduino 

OpLab - cardboard synth 

Ototo kickstarter - makeymakey style thing.

Rachel Binx - An act of love to look at something twice. 

Douglas Edric Stanley - Taking a photo knowing how it's going to be processed (cf "writing for google")
Photo of napoleon's nephew. http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/13084.Roland_Barthes

Computational photograph using a whole batch of tagged images and seeing what the algorithm makes of them. Photo stitch / panorama style. Tiling / mosaic. 

Photogrammetry 

Google - all the analysis that goes on behind the gaze. Google Glass minus Google = good. Cf Oculous Facebook.

Live single pixel slitscan. 
Abstract forms in space. 
Uses vvvv
Projection mapping without intention of illusion. 
Radio waves.  Recording invisible stuff and printing it out. Photographs of reality at different places in spectrum. 3D spaces.

MATTHIEU CHERUBINI

Idea: Using a neural network to interrogate the world and jake decisions. NN camera? Sensors for environment and radio waves determine exposure, angle, etc. Ethical choices built into NN. Only photograph certain people. Filter bubble built in to camera.
